1. Add vulnerabilities from other tools
2. Upload your custom vulnerability templates
3. Schedule Assessments and Retests
4. Track remediation 
5. Manage Users
6. and much more. 

The easiest way to access the REST API for your faction instance is to click on your profile in the top right corner. Here you will find a link to the Swagger API docs and access to your API Key
