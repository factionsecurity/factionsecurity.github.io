Faction's open-source versions will not automatically update the Table of Contents page numbering though the hyperlinks all work as expected.  You can do this manually by clicking the table and selecting _Update Field_ on the generated report.

The enterprise versions of Faction will automatically update the numbering for you as well as provide other additional reporting features like different finding sections (i.e. Application Security Pen Test Findings Section and Network Security Findings Section) and DOCX and PDF export options.
